Which of the following best describes the result?\n","\n","Correct Answer: The sum of all integers in the array.\n","\n","Explanation: This is a classic accumulator pattern, where each element is added to a running total.\n","\n","Feedback: Watch out for off-by-one errors in the loop bounds or mistakenly initializing the sum to a non-zero value. Always double-check that you're adding, not multiplying or assigning.\n","\n","✅ MCQ 2: Inheritance and Overriding\n","Question: A subclass overrides a method from a superclass. What determines which method is executed?\n","\n","Correct Answer: The type of the object at runtime.\n","\n","Explanation: Java uses dynamic method dispatch for overridden methods, meaning the version corresponding to the object’s actual type (not the reference type) is used.\n","\n","Feedback: Many students confuse this with overloading. Overloading is resolved at compile-time, while overriding is resolved at runtime.\n","\n","✅ MCQ 3: Boolean Logic\n","Question: Which expression evaluates to true only when one of the conditions is true, but not both?\n","\n","Correct Answer: The exclusive OR (XOR) condition.\n","\n","Explanation: XOR logic returns true if exactly one operand is true. If both are false or both are true, the result is false.\n","\n","Feedback: Be careful with || versus XOR. || is inclusive and will return true even if both sides are true. XOR is stricter.\n","\n","✅ MCQ 4: ArrayList Behavior\n","Question: What happens when you modify an ArrayList while iterating over it with a for-each loop?\n","\n","Correct Answer: It throws a ConcurrentModificationException.\n","\n","Explanation: The enhanced for-loop uses an internal iterator. Modifying the list structurally while using it this way causes runtime errors.\n","\n","Feedback: Use an index-based for loop if you need to remove or modify elements during iteration.\n","\n","✅ MCQ 5: Constructors and Overloading\n","Question: What happens if a class has no constructor explicitly defined?\n","\n","Correct Answer: Java provides a default no-argument constructor.\n","\n","Explanation: This constructor simply allocates memory and initializes default values (e.g., 0, null).\n","\n","Feedback: Once you define any constructor (even one with parameters), Java will no longer generate a default one. You must define it manually if needed.\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b5aeaaa5","metadata":{},"source":["## 🧾 Final Summary: Concepts Learned (2019–2024)\n","- Array traversal and modification\n","- Conditionals and loops\n","- Object instantiation and constructors\n","- Encapsulation and class structure\n","- Logical problem decomposition\n","- Understanding randomness, scheduling, and game simulations\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"e9aa98ee","metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"plaintext"}},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
