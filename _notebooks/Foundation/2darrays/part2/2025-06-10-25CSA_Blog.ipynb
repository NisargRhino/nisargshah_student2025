        "\n",
        "##  Qualities\n",
        "- Strong debugging skills and backend logic implementation.\n",
        "- Proactive problem solver â€“ for example, I implemented user-agent rotation to bypass HTTP 429 errors (rate limiting).\n",
        "- Passionate about connecting coding to real-world applications, like economics and finance.\n",
