## Project Introduction

> "Investing education reimagined for the classroom."

## Backend System

### Flask-Based Financial Engine

The backend handles financial data processing, user authentication, transaction logic, and price caching.

#### Key Features:
- Live market data from **Yahoo Finance API**  
- Optimized caching to reduce rate-limit issues  
- Secure and trackable buy/sell transactions  
- Real-time profit/loss calculation per portfolio  
- Persistent user sessions and login system

### ðŸ“Œ Sample Backend Code: Fetch Stock Data

```python
# /api/get_stock_data/<ticker>
from flask import Flask, jsonify
import yfinance as yf

@app.route("/api/get_stock_data/<ticker>", methods=["GET"])
def get_stock_data(ticker):
    stock = yf.Ticker(ticker)
    data = stock.history(period="1d", interval="1m")
    return jsonify({
        "price": stock.info.get('currentPrice'),
        "volume": stock.info.get('volume'),
        "dayHigh": stock.info.get('dayHigh'),
        "dayLow": stock.info.get('dayLow'),
        "fiftyTwoWeekHigh": stock.info.get('fiftyTwoWeekHigh'),
        "fiftyTwoWeekLow": stock.info.get('fiftyTwoWeekLow'),
    })
````

### ðŸ“Œ Sample Backend Code: Add Stock to Portfolio

```python
# /api/add_stock (POST)
@app.route("/api/add_stock", methods=["POST"])
def add_stock():
    data = request.json
    user_id = data.get("user_id")
    ticker = data.get("ticker")
    quantity = int(data.get("quantity"))
    price = float(data.get("price"))

    # Save to DB (simplified)
    new_transaction = StockTransaction(
        user_id=user_id,
        ticker=ticker.upper(),
        quantity=quantity,
        price=price
    )
    db.session.add(new_transaction)
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify({"status": "success", "message": f"Added {quantity} shares of {ticker}."})
```
